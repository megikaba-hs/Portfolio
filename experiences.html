            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Soft & Solution</p>
            <p>
              I worked as a full-stack developer using WLanguage, the proprietary
              programming language of the French platform PC Soft. My
              responsibilities included developing and maintaining applications,
              building user interfaces, and managing backend processes. During
              this time, I gained hands-on experience in designing scalable
              solutions, optimizing code, and integrating various software
              components to deliver effective business solutions.

            <p style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Gran IT</p>
            <p>
              I developed and maintained backend services using SpringBoot,
              focusing on building robust and scalable web applications. My role
              involved designing RESTful APIs, integrating databases, and ensuring
              seamless communication between front-end and back-end systems. I
              implemented key features such as user authentication, data
              processing, and error handling while maintaining code quality and
              optimizing performance.

            <p style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Honest Solutions</p>
            <p>
              During my internship, I worked on developing full-stack web
              applications using React for the front-end and Node.js for the
              back-end. I was responsible for building responsive user interfaces,
              implementing server-side logic, and managing data flow between the
              client and server. I gained hands-on experience in developing
              RESTful APIs, handling state management, and deploying applications,
              while ensuring code efficiency and maintainability.
